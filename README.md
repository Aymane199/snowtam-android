# Snowtam decoder

## Description

Decoding a SNOWTAM is something that most pilots do on a regular basis, especially when they frequently fly in extremely cold weather conditions. 
Therefore, it makes sense to provide these pilots with a tool that will help them decode the report quickly and accurately.

The solution is a simple and intuitive android application using airport codes in ICAO format entered by the user, 
it will search for SnowTam, decode them and display them via an interface. The application will take into account the search and display the location of the airport.
